This project implemented the serial version, OpenMP version and Pthread version for quick sort algorithm(under the directory ./qsort) and Gaussian elimination algorithm(under the directory ./guassian).

To run this code and get result, we also provide a auto test script. sh auto.sh to run it.

Running time file recorded the result of our experiments.
